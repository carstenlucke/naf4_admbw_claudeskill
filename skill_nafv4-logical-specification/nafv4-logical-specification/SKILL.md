# NAF v4 Logical Specification Modeling for Sparx Enterprise Architect

## Overview

This skill enables natural language interaction with Sparx Enterprise Architect's MCP server to create NAF v4 / ADMBw compliant Logical Specification Viewpoints. It translates informal user requests into precise MCP tool calls with correct stereotypes, UML types, and profiles.

## Core Workflow

When the user requests NAF logical specification modeling:

1. **Parse the request** - Identify what the user wants (diagram, element, or association)
2. **Map to NAF metamodel** - Translate natural language to formal stereotypes using references
3. **Execute MCP calls** - Create or update models in Sparx EA
4. **Confirm and offer next steps** - Show what was created and suggest related actions

## Key Principles

- **Interpret flexibly** - Accept natural language like "add a logical node" or "create information flow"
- **Map precisely** - Always use exact stereotypes and UML types from the metamodel
- **Auto-name when needed** - If user provides description but no name, generate concise technical name
- **Validate connections** - Check metaconstraints before creating associations (see JSON data)
- **Ask when ambiguous** - Offer options if request could map to multiple stereotypes

## Supported Viewpoints

| Viewpoint | ID | Purpose | Common Requests |
|-----------|----|---------|-----------------|
| Node Types | L1 | Define nodes with measures of performance | "Create L1 diagram", "Add operational performer", "Define node capabilities" |
| Logical Scenario | L2 | Specify nodes in context with flows | "Create L2 diagram", "Show information flows", "Add logical scenario" |
| Node Interactions | L3 | Detail interoperability requirements | "Create L3 diagram", "Add operational exchange", "Define node interactions" |
| Logical Activities | L4 | Describe logical operational activities | "Create L4 diagram", "Add operational activity", "Show activity flows" |
| Logical States | L5 | Specify node states and transitions | "Create L5 diagram", "Add state machine", "Define state transitions" |
| Logical Sequence | L6 | Trace event sequences between nodes | "Create L6 diagram", "Add sequence diagram", "Show operational messages" |
| Information Model | L7 | Document business information | "Create L7 diagram", "Add information element", "Define data model" |
| Logical Constraints | L8 | Constrain logical architecture | "Create L8 diagram", "Add operational constraint", "Define logical rules" |
| Lines of Development | Lr | Support acquisition and dependencies | "Create Lr diagram", "Add project milestone", "Show capability roadmap" |

## Creating Diagrams

To create a NAF logical specification diagram, use the MCP `create_or_update_diagram` tool:

```javascript
{
  "name": "<diagram-name>",
  "type": "<diagram-type>",  // "Custom" for L1-L5, L7, L8, Lr; "Sequence" for L6
  "stereotype": "<viewpoint-identifier>",  // e.g. "L1", "L2", "L3", "L4", "L5", "L6", "L7", "L8", "Lr"
  "packagePath": "<package-path>",  // e.g. "Model/Logical Specification"
  "extendedProperties": {
    "alias": "<full-viewpoint-name>",  // e.g. "L1 - Node Types"
    "diagramID": "<viewpoint-id>",     // e.g. "L1"
    "toolbox": "<toolbox-name>"        // e.g. "NAFv4-ADMBw-L1-Toolbox"
  }
}
```

**Important:** L6 (Logical Sequence) uses diagram type "Sequence", all other viewpoints use "Custom".

**Example user requests:**
- "Create an L1 diagram called 'Surveillance System Nodes'"
- "Make a new Logical Scenario view"
- "I need an L4 diagram for operational activities"
- "Create a sequence diagram for L6"

## Creating Elements

To create a NAF logical specification element, use the MCP `create_or_update_element` tool:

```javascript
{
  "name": "<element-name>",
  "type": "<uml-type>",           // e.g. "Class", "Activity", "Part", "Port", "Object", "StateMachine"
  "stereotype": "<NAF-stereotype>", // e.g. "OperationalPerformer", "OperationalActivity"
  "packagePath": "<package-path>",
  "notes": "<description>",        // User's full description text
  "profile": "NAFv4-ADMBw"        // Always use this profile
}
```

**Auto-naming logic:**
When user provides description but no name, generate a concise technical identifier:
- Extract key concepts from description
- Use PascalCase or hyphenated format
- Keep to 3-5 words maximum
- Example: "Command and control node" → "CommandControlNode" or "C2-Node"

**Example user requests:**
- "Add operational performer called 'ISR Node'"
- "Create OperationalActivity named 'DetectTargets'"
- "Add an information element for 'Target Location Data'"
- "Create a state machine for the radar node"
- "Add operational performer: A logical node responsible for command and control functions"

## Creating Associations

To create connections between elements, use the MCP `create_or_update_connector` tool:

```javascript
{
  "sourceElementName": "<source-element>",
  "targetElementName": "<target-element>",
  "connectorType": "<uml-connector-type>",  // e.g. "Connector", "InformationFlow", "Dependency", "Abstraction"
  "stereotype": "<NAF-stereotype>",          // e.g. "OperationalExchange", "IsCapableToPerform"
  "packagePath": "<package-path>",
  "profile": "NAFv4-ADMBw"
}
```

**Before creating associations, validate:**
1. Load `references/logical_specification_viewpoints.json` if not already in context
2. Check metaconstraints for the desired stereotype
3. Ensure source element stereotype matches valid `client` constraint
4. Ensure target element stereotype matches valid `supplier` constraint
5. If invalid, explain to user and suggest valid alternatives

**Example user requests:**
- "Create information flow from ISR Node to C2 Node"
- "Link DetectTargets activity to ISR Node with 'capable to perform'"
- "Add operational exchange carrying 'Target Data' between nodes"
- "Show that RadarNode exhibits 'Surveillance Capability'"

## Handling Ambiguity

When user request could map to multiple stereotypes:

1. **Identify possibilities** - Check `stereotype_mappings.md` and JSON data
2. **Present 2-4 options** - Show most likely matches with brief explanation
3. **Let user choose** - Wait for clarification before proceeding
4. **Execute** - Proceed with selected option

**Example interaction:**
```
User: "Add a node to the diagram"

Claude: "I can create several types of nodes. Which would you like?

1. **OperationalPerformer** - A logical entity that performs operational activities (most common for L1/L2)
2. **OperationalRole** - A usage of a performer in a specific context
3. **OperationalArchitecture** - An entire architecture from operational perspective

Which type fits your needs?"
```

## Natural Language Mapping

Load `references/stereotype_mappings.md` for quick lookup when user uses casual terminology:
- "logical node" → OperationalPerformer
- "information flow" → OperationalExchange
- "capable to perform" → IsCapableToPerform
- "data model" → DataModel

For detailed metamodel constraints, properties, and valid connections, reference `references/logical_specification_viewpoints.json`.

## Progressive Data Loading

**Always in context:** Core workflow and mapping principles (this SKILL.md file)

**Load on demand:**
- `references/stereotype_mappings.md` - When mapping user's natural language to formal stereotypes
- `references/logical_specification_viewpoints.json` - When validating metaconstraints, checking detailed properties, or resolving complex associations

This keeps responses efficient while ensuring access to complete metamodel data when needed.

## Common Patterns

     "profile": "NAFv4-ADMBw"
   }
3. Create Satisfy relationship (type: Dependency) from constraint to affected elements
4. Optional: Create JustifiedBy relationship to DocumentReference for traceability
```

## Error Handling

### Element Not Found
- Use MCP `find_elements_by_name` to search for element
- If multiple matches, present list and ask user to clarify (by GUID or package path)
- If none found, offer to create the element
- Ask for element details if creation is needed

### Invalid Connection Attempt
- Load `logical_specification_viewpoints.json` and check metaconstraints
- Explain why the connection is invalid (stereotype mismatch)
- Look up valid alternatives from the same viewpoint
- Suggest correct stereotypes for both source and target

### Ambiguous Viewpoint Context
- If user says "add node" without viewpoint context, check current open diagram
- If no diagram context available, ask which viewpoint (L1-L8, Lr) they're working in
- Default to L1 for node definitions if user is unsure
- Explain briefly what each viewpoint is for

### Missing Package Path
- If package path not specified, check current package using get_current_package
- If no current package, ask user where to create element
- Suggest logical locations like "Model/Logical Specification" or similar

### Diagram Type Confusion
- Remember: L6 uses diagram type "Sequence", all others use "Custom"
- If user creates L6 with wrong type, explain the special case
- Offer to recreate with correct type if needed

## Viewpoint-Specific Guidance

### L1 - Node Types
- Focus on defining OperationalPerformer elements
- Add MeasurementType elements for measures of performance (MoPs)

- Use ProjectSequence and MilestoneDependency for dependencies
- Add IsResponsibleFor and IsAccountableFor for accountability
- Link to CapabilityConfiguration for capability delivery
- Use VersionReleased and VersionWithdrawn for releases

## Tips for Effective Usage

- **Be specific about viewpoints** - "Create L2 diagram" is clearer than generic "logical diagram"
- **Use natural language freely** - "Information flow" works as well as formal "OperationalExchange"
- **Provide context when possible** - Mentioning parent elements or current diagram helps placement
- **Combine operations** - "Create L1 with radar node exhibiting surveillance capability" is efficient and clear
- **Trust auto-naming** - For elements with long descriptions, let the skill generate concise names
- **Validate before complex operations** - For critical models, ask skill to verify connections first
- **Remember L6 is special** - It uses Sequence diagram type, not Custom

## Reference Files

This skill includes two reference files for progressive data loading:

- **references/stereotype_mappings.md** - Quick reference for stereotype lookup and natural language → formal term mapping
- **references/logical_specification_viewpoints.json** - Complete NAF v4 Logical Specification metamodel extracted from MDG with all stereotypes, properties, metaconstraints, and toolbox definitions
